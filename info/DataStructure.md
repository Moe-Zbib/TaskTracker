Task Queues:

Use a queue data structure to manage the task queue within each project group.
When a new task is submitted, enqueue it into the appropriate task queue.
Workers (developers or testers) can dequeue tasks from the queue based on priority and availability.
Stacks for Task Progress:

Use a stack data structure to track task progress and status changes.
When a user updates the status of a task, push the new status onto the stack.
You can easily backtrack through status changes by popping items from the stack.
Arrays and Lists for Comments:

Implement arrays or lists to store comments and feedback associated with each task.
When a user adds a comment or provides feedback, append it to the array or list of comments.
Hash Maps for User and Task Data:

Utilize hash maps (also known as dictionaries or objects in some programming languages) to store user data and task details efficiently.
Users can be looked up by their unique IDs, and tasks can be accessed by task IDs.
This allows for fast retrieval and modification of user and task information.
Linked Lists for Task Dependencies:

If your tasks have dependencies on each other, consider using linked lists to represent these dependencies.
Each node in the list can represent a task, and pointers can indicate dependencies between tasks.
Arrays for Analytics and Reporting:

Use arrays or data structures like data cubes to store historical data for analytics.
For example, you can maintain an array of completion times for tasks to calculate average completion times.
Queues for Task Assignment and Load Balancing:

Implement queues to manage the assignment of tasks to team members.
When a task needs to be assigned, enqueue it in the appropriate task assignment queue.
Workers can dequeue tasks from their respective queues when they are ready to work on them.
Hash Maps for Admin Oversight:

Admin dashboards can use hash maps to quickly look up and display task and project information.
Hash maps allow for efficient data retrieval based on keys such as task IDs or project names.
Arrays and Lists for Data Integrity:

When implementing data integrity checks, you may use arrays or lists to store data validation results or error messages.
Hash Maps for Data Backup and Recovery:

For data backup and recovery purposes, you can use hash maps to store snapshots or versions of critical data.
