Group Creation and Management:

Implement a way for users to create private groups. This could involve defining a group name, description, and privacy settings.
Set up a mechanism to manage group memberships and permissions. Decide whether group creators have administrative rights.
Invitation System:

Design a system for sending invitations to users. Invitations could be sent via email or through the application.
Create a way for users to accept or decline invitations to join a group.
Task Assignment within Groups:

Extend your task structure to include information about which group a task belongs to.
Implement the logic for assigning tasks to specific groups. Task creators/admins should be able to assign tasks to a particular group's members.
Group-Level Task Views:

Develop a feature that allows users within a group to see a list of tasks assigned to that group.
Users should be able to filter and sort tasks within their group.
Task Ownership and Progress Tracking:

Assign tasks to specific group members or allow members to claim tasks they intend to complete.
Implement a way to track task progress within the group and update task statuses accordingly.
Privacy and Security:

Ensure that only group members can access and interact with the group's tasks.
Implement appropriate access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
User Interface Updates:

Modify your user interface to accommodate the new features related to groups, invitations, and group-specific task management.
Communication and Notifications:

Design a system for group members to communicate within the group context. This could involve adding comments or discussion threads to tasks.
Implement notifications to inform group members about task assignments, updates, and comments.
Testing and Validation:

Thoroughly test the new features to ensure they work as expected in various scenarios.
Validate the privacy and security aspects to prevent any unauthorized access.
Documentation:

Update your project documentation to include information about the new group-related features and how they work.
Usability Considerations:

Keep the user experience intuitive and user-friendly. Ensure that users can easily create groups, invite members, and manage tasks within groups.
