Implement Rate Limiting: To prevent brute force attacks on login endpoints, you can implement rate limiting. Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address within a certain time period.

Use HTTPS: Ensure that your application is served over HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Consider adding two-factor authentication for an extra layer of security. Users will need to provide a second form of verification in addition to their password.

Password Complexity: Enforce strong password policies that require a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Discourage the use of common passwords.

Password Reset with Expiry: If you offer a password reset feature, make sure that reset links have a limited lifespan. This prevents attackers from using old reset links to gain access.

Account Lockout: Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts. Users will need to contact support to unlock their account.

Secure Session Management: Use secure session management techniques. Store session tokens in HTTP-only cookies and set appropriate expiration times.

Token Expiry: For JWTs, set a reasonable expiration time and implement token refresh mechanisms to prevent long-lived tokens.

Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common web vulnerabilities.

Audit Logs: Maintain logs of user activity and authentication-related events. This can help identify suspicious behavior or unauthorized access.

Regular Updates and Patching: Keep your backend dependencies, libraries, and frameworks up to date to mitigate security vulnerabilities.

Security Headers: Implement security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP), X-Content-Type-Options, and X-Frame-Options to prevent various types of attacks.

Third-Party Libraries: Be cautious when using third-party libraries and dependencies. Make sure they are actively maintained and have a good security track record.

Security Audits: Periodically conduct security audits or penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in your application.

Educate Users: Provide security tips to users, such as not sharing passwords, logging out from shared computers, and being cautious with email links.
